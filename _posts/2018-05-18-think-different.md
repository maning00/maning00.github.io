Here's to the crazy ones.

The misfits.

The rebels.

The troublemakers.

The round pegs in the square holes.

The ones who see things differently.

They're not fond of rules

And they have no respect for the status quo.

You can praise them, quote them, disagree with them
disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them.

About the only thing that you can't do is ignore them.

Because they change things.

They invent.  
  
They imagine.

They heal.

They explore. 

They create. 

They inspire.

They push the human race forward.

Maybe they have to be crazy.

How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?

Or sit in silence and hear a song that's never been written?

Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?

We make tools for these kinds of people.

While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.

Because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.

向那些疯狂的家伙们致敬，

他们特立独行，

他们桀骜不驯，

他们惹是生非，

他们格格不入，

他们用与众不同的眼光看待事物，

他们不喜欢墨守成规，

他们也不愿安于现状。

你可以赞美他们，引用他们，反对他们，

质疑他们，颂扬或是诋毁他们，

但唯独不能漠视他们。

因为他们改变了事物。

他们发明，他们想象，他们治愈，

他们探索，他们创造，他们启迪，

他们推动人类向前发展。

也许，他们必需要疯狂。

你能盯着白纸，就看到美妙的画作么？

你能静静坐着，就听见美妙的歌曲么？

你能凝视火星，就想到神奇的太空轮么？

我们为这些家伙制造良机。

或许他们是别人眼里的疯子，

但他们却是我们眼中的天才。

因为只有那些疯狂到以为自己能够改变世界的人，

才能真正地改变世界。
